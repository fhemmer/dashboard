React does not recognize the `whileHover` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `whilehover` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.

`DialogContent` requires a `DialogTitle` for the component to be accessible for screen reader users.

If you want to hide the `DialogTitle`, you can wrap it with our VisuallyHidden component.
